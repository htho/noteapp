## About

This project is a place for me (and maybe others) to learn the basics of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Dexie](http://dexie.org/) and [NgDexie](https://github.com/FlussoBV/NgDexie).
According to their websites, Angular *enhances HTML for web apps*, while Dexie is "*A Minimalistic Wrapper for IndexedDB*" and NgDexie is an "*AngularJS wrapper around the Dexie.js library*".

This is just a place to learn the technology. Since web apps get more complex, I also had tp learn other tools and concepts.

This Project also uses
Gulp - which "*automates and enhances your workflow*" and
Bower - which is "*A package manager for the web*".

Since I also am interested in progressive web apps, it is possible that I will enhance this app even further.

## Why this App?

The examples in [NgDexies Documentation](https://github.com/FlussoBV/NgDexie/wiki/QuickStart) often hint at a simple note taking app.
This app takes notes using NgDexie. It does not necessarily use all of NgDexies features. It also does not use the same variables or names as the documentation. But it is close.
